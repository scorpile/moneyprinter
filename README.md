This is a Python - Binance Trading Autonomous Bot

It is based on https://github.com/xozxro/cryptoprinter, who also based it on Nyria's work.

I did a complete refactor of the script, for using it with Binance API instead of FX and yFinance.

At his moment, i have the Discord and Binance integration fully working, but i am testing the entry conditions because it is not entering on any trade.  Debuging those rules takes a lot of time.

I have another 3 Trade Bots of my own creation, and those starts trades a little too fast, so they end with a profit of 0% (not good, but not bad), and i am testing all of those bots at the same time.
