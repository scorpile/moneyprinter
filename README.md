## üìù Detailed Trading Strategy

### 1. Technical Indicators Utilized

- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):**
  - Measures the speed and change of price movements.
  - Identifies overbought or oversold conditions.

- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**
  - A trend-following momentum indicator.
  - Consists of the MACD line, signal line, and histogram.

- **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP):**
  - Provides the average price a security has traded at throughout the day.
  - Serves as a benchmark for assessing the current price level.

- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**
  - EMAs give more weight to recent prices, making them more responsive.
  - Uses EMA12, EMA26, and EMA5 to determine short-term and medium-term trends.

- **Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH):**
  - Compares a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period.
  - Identifies overbought and oversold levels.

### 2. Trade Entry Conditions

The strategy identifies buy opportunities based on two primary sets of conditions: **Trade A** and **Trade B**.

#### **Trade A Conditions:**

- **RSI Threshold:** RSI below 35 (oversold conditions).
- **RSI Trend:** Increasing compared to the previous value (potential upward momentum).
- **Price vs. EMA5:** Closing price above the 5-period EMA (short-term uptrend).
- **MACD Confirmation:** Current MACD value higher than the previous value (bullish momentum).
- **RSI Stability:** RSI not in a downtrend (maintained bullish momentum).

#### **Trade B Conditions:**

- **RSI Threshold:** RSI below 30 (strong oversold conditions).
- **MACD Trend:** Decreasing over the last three periods but starting to rise (potential reversal).
- **Histogram Direction:** Increasing MACD histogram (supports bullish signal).
- **Price vs. EMA12:** Closing price above the 12-period EMA (medium-term uptrend).
- **RSI Level:** RSI below 45 (avoids overbought scenarios while indicating upward momentum).

When either set of conditions is met, the bot initiates a **BUY** order (LONG position) and enters a "watching" mode to monitor the trade's progress.

### 3. Trade Execution and Monitoring

Upon meeting the entry conditions, the bot performs the following actions:

- **Placing Orders:**
  - Executes a **BUY** order using the `placeOrder` method.
  - Sends a notification to a Discord webhook detailing the trade execution.

- **Logging:**
  - Records trade details, including timestamp, price, and indicator values, into a CSV file for future reference and analysis.

- **Watching Mode:**
  - Monitors the trade's progress by continuously fetching new market data.
  - Evaluates price relative to EMAs and monitors RSI and MACD trends to decide on exiting the trade.

### 4. Trade Exit Conditions

The strategy employs multiple exit conditions to secure profits or minimize losses:

- **Profit Targets:**
  - **Immediate Profit:** If the price difference from the entry point exceeds \$0.40, a **SELL** order is triggered.
  - **Incremental Profit:** If the price difference surpasses the last recorded difference by \$0.12, the bot considers selling to capitalize on upward movement.

- **Stop-Loss Mechanism:**
  - **Price Drop:** If the price falls more than 13% below the entry point, a **SELL** order is executed.
  - **Additional Drop:** If the price declines by an additional 3% (totaling a 16% drop), the bot exits the trade.

- **Trend Reversal:**
  - **RSI and MACD Indicators:** If RSI declines and MACD shows a downward trend, indicating weakening bullish momentum, the bot exits the trade.

- **Timeouts:**
  - **Iteration Limit:** If the bot remains in watching mode for 10 iterations without meeting any exit conditions, it automatically exits the trade.

### 5. Risk Management and Data Handling

- **Dynamic MACD Threshold:**
  - Calculates a dynamic MACD threshold based on the 10th percentile of recent MACD values to identify potential reversal points.

- **Data Logging and Trimming:**
  - Maintains a history of indicator values and trends.
  - Trims historical data to retain only the most recent 30 to 50 data points for responsiveness.

- **Discord Notifications:**
  - Provides real-time updates on trade executions, including BUY and SELL orders, current price, RSI, MACD, and other relevant indicators.
  - Alerts the user when monitoring for potential trades or when critical errors occur.

### 6. Overall Strategy Workflow

1. **Initialization:**
   - Sets up necessary variables and creates a CSV file to log trades.
   - Sends a start message to Discord to indicate that the trading bot is active.

2. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Continuously fetches current, 5-minute, and 15-minute interval market data, including price, volume, and indicator values.

3. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Compares the latest data with historical data to identify trends in price, RSI, MACD, VWAP, STOCH, and EMAs.
   - Determines whether indicators are in a downtrend or showing signs of reversal.

4. **Trade Decision Making:**
   - Evaluates whether the current market conditions meet the predefined criteria for **Trade A** or **Trade B**.
   - If conditions are met, executes a **BUY** order and enters the watching mode to monitor the trade.

5. **Trade Monitoring and Exit:**
   - In watching mode, the bot continuously assesses new data to decide whether to hold, realize profits, or cut losses based on exit conditions.
   - Logs all relevant data and updates Discord notifications accordingly.

6. **Loop Continuation:**
   - After exiting a trade, the bot resumes data acquisition and trend analysis to identify new trading opportunities.
